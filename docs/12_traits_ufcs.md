# Traits & UFCS

EMP supports trait-like interfaces and UFCS-style calls (as validated by the test suite).

Key tests:

- `tests/ll/trait_ufcs_ok.em`
- `tests/trait/trait_missing_impl_fail.em`
- `tests/trait/trait_missing_method_fail.em`
- `tests/trait/trait_sig_mismatch_fail.em`

This documentation describes behavior at a high level; the current test suite is the executable spec.
